# ggml-docs

Unofficial API reference for [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml). The docs were generated by automatically parsing the headers in `ggml` (commit [9a4acb3](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/tree/9a4acb3)).

* [ggml functions](functions.md)
* [ggml structs](structs.md)
* [ggml enums](enums.md)
* [ggml typedefs](typedefs.md)

This repo is not affiliated with the `ggml` project. I generated these docs for my reference, while experimenting with ggml. Please feel free to use them and submit PRs if they're out-of-date.
